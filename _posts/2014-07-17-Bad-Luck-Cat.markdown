description: Bad Luck Cat is a road crossing game in which you play as a black cat. Unlike the traditional road crossing games, crossing the road safely will not score you any points! We devloped the game in 3 days for Wowie Jam 3.0. The topic was "FAILURE IS PROGRESS - Let's mess with the concepts of winning and losing". I did the programming and music and Daniel Bluchu did the art. We were ranked 2nd place out of 1,016 entries to the jam. Because we made the top 10, the game was featured in Jonas Tyroller's YouTube video "We Made 1023 Games Where [FAILURE is PROGRESS]".
