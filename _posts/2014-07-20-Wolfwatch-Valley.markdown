description: (Placeholder) This game was made in about 1.5 weeks for Minigame a Month - April 2024. The theme was "FARMING". This game is my first finished project made in Unreal Engine. Harvest crops, sell them to the shop and buy upgrades, all while defending your pigs from the wolves! Earn as much money as possible before all your pigs are gone to get the highscore.
