description: Neon Wings is a pixel art Android game that I developed with Daniel Bluchu in my free time during my final year of university. I did the programming and music and Daniel Bluchu did the art. You play as a pilot who is on the run from war and you must survive as long as possible by dodging enemies and collecting power-ups. However, to add to the difficulty, the background constantly changes colour, hiding and revealing different enemies.
