description: SoundVerse VR is a platform for live virtual reality concerts that I developed for my masters thesis “Live, VR concerts using HMDs” at University of Bristol. The musician can import their own sound files and perform their music using virtual instruments (a loop pad and a keyboard). It supports Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and other headsets.
