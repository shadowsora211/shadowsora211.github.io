description: (Placeholder) Made in 3 days for Cozy Spring Jam 2024. The jam theme was "New Beginnings". This game is a follow up to our game for Cozy Winter Jam 2023, Cold Out 64, with a few recurring characters. Move into your new town, make new friends, and take great photos. There are 2 different endings depending on whether you take the bonus photo.
