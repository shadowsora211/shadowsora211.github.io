description: Pitch Dash is a rhythm game for studying Japanese pitch accent! The game helps you learn the pitch accent patterns for 175 common words, including lots of words that have the same reading but different pitch accent like 雨 (あ↑め↓) and 飴 (あ↓め↑). The game is free on the Google Play store. It was developed in Unity and I created all assets for the game including the soundtrack. I made this game because I wanted to start studying Japanese pitch accent, but I couldn't find many resources to do so. I hope this game can help others who are interested in studying it!
